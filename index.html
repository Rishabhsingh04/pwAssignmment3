    <b>Web Accessbility -: </b> Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and
    developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand,
    navigate, and interact with the Web. contribute to the Web.
    <br>

    <b>Website Accessible - :</b>Many aspects of accessibility are fairly easy to understand and implement. Some
    accessibility solutions are more complex and take more knowledge to implement.

    It is most efficient and effective to incorporate accessibility from the very beginning of projects, so you donâ€™t
    need go back and to re-do work.

    <b>Well-Structured HTML - :</b>
    When sighted users land on a web page, their eyes dart around the page in search of their desired content. A screen
    reader, however, processes pages in a linear manner it starts at the top of the HTML and reads down through each
    page element one-by-one.
    <br><br>
    <b> Descriptive Hyperlinks</b>
    When designing for better accessibility, we want to inform users what to expect before they take a particular action
    on a page. The most common action a user can take is clicking a link to a different page before a user does this,
    they should know where they are going from the link text alone, without any additional context <br><br>
    <b>HTML Semantic -: </b>When writing web pages, the single best way to make them accessible is to use semantic HTML.
    Semantic HTML is HTML code that says what it does in other words, the tag itself conveys the purpose of the element.
    Semantically rich elements include button, form, header, foote, nav, and the headings h1,h2, etc.

    <h3>Three features of HTML5</h3>

    <b>1 - Intro of audio and video : </b>
    <p>Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their
        website</p>

    <b>2 - Vector Graphics : </b>
    <p>This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It
        can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors. Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and
        edit. It also supports interactivity.
    </p>
    <b>3 - Header and Footer Tag : </b>
    <p>With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a div tag. Footer is placed at
        the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By using header tag and footer tag
        HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later. </p>
